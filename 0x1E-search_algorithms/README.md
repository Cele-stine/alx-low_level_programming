#  SEARCH ALGORITHM - C
This directory is ment for learning about search algorithms.
__Search algorithm is an algorithm desingned to solve a search problem.__
Search algorithm can be classified into:
*linear search algorithm
 binary search algorithm
 hashing search algorithm*

# Files

## 0-linear.c
A function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.
*Linear search algorithm is a method of finding an element within a list by sequentialy cheking each element in the list until a match is found or  the whole list has been searched.*

## 1-binary.c
A function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.
*Binary search algorithm finds the position o the target value within a sorted array. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.*
